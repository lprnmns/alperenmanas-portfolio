# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Google Analytics tracking into the Next.js project to enable website analytics and user behavior tracking. The implementation will use the Google Analytics 4 (GA4) gtag.js library with the tracking ID G-WH4BNMLW1R to collect page views, user interactions, and other relevant metrics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to track page views and user interactions on my website, so that I can analyze user behavior and make data-driven decisions about my content and user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits any page on the website THEN the Google Analytics tracking script SHALL load and initialize with the correct tracking ID (G-WH4BNMLW1R)
2. WHEN a page loads THEN a page view event SHALL be automatically sent to Google Analytics
3. WHEN the tracking script loads THEN it SHALL not block or significantly delay the page rendering
4. IF JavaScript is disabled in the user's browser THEN the website SHALL continue to function normally without analytics tracking

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Google Analytics integration to be properly configured in the Next.js application, so that it follows Next.js best practices and works correctly with client-side routing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application uses Next.js routing THEN page view events SHALL be tracked for both initial page loads and client-side navigation
2. WHEN the Google Analytics script is implemented THEN it SHALL be loaded asynchronously to avoid blocking page rendering
3. WHEN the application is built for production THEN the Google Analytics tracking SHALL be active and functional
4. IF the application is running in development mode THEN the Google Analytics tracking MAY be conditionally enabled or disabled based on environment configuration

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to ensure user privacy compliance, so that the analytics implementation respects user privacy preferences and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Google Analytics script loads THEN it SHALL use the standard gtag.js implementation as provided by Google
2. WHEN analytics data is collected THEN it SHALL follow Google's standard data collection practices
3. WHEN implementing the tracking THEN the solution SHALL be compatible with common privacy tools and cookie consent mechanisms
4. IF required by local regulations THEN the implementation SHALL support easy integration with cookie consent solutions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Google Analytics implementation to be maintainable and configurable, so that tracking IDs and settings can be easily updated without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tracking ID needs to be changed THEN it SHALL be configurable through environment variables or configuration files
2. WHEN the application is deployed to different environments THEN different tracking IDs MAY be used for each environment
3. WHEN the Google Analytics configuration needs updates THEN changes SHALL be centralized in a single location
4. IF additional Google Analytics features are needed in the future THEN the implementation SHALL support easy extension and modification
