# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will integrate Vercel Analytics into the Alperen Manas portfolio website to provide additional web analytics capabilities alongside the existing Google Analytics implementation. Vercel Analytics offers seamless integration with Next.js applications and provides insights into page views, user interactions, and performance metrics directly within the Vercel dashboard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want to track visitor analytics using Vercel Analytics, so that I can gain insights into user behavior and site performance through the Vercel dashboard.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website is deployed to Vercel THEN Vercel Analytics SHALL be enabled and configured
2. WHEN a user visits any page THEN the analytics tracking SHALL record the page view
3. WHEN analytics data is collected THEN it SHALL be viewable in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab
4. WHEN the site is accessed THEN a network request to `/_vercel/insights/view` SHALL be visible in browser developer tools

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install and configure the Vercel Analytics package, so that the tracking functionality is properly integrated into the Next.js application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is set up THEN the `@vercel/analytics` package SHALL be installed as a dependency
2. WHEN the application builds THEN there SHALL be no build errors related to the analytics integration
3. WHEN the Analytics component is imported THEN it SHALL be from the correct Next.js-specific package path
4. WHEN the application runs in development THEN the analytics SHALL work without errors

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to add the Analytics component to the root layout, so that analytics tracking is available across all pages of the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the root layout renders THEN the Analytics component SHALL be included in the component tree
2. WHEN any page loads THEN the analytics tracking SHALL be active
3. WHEN the Analytics component is added THEN it SHALL not interfere with existing Google Analytics implementation
4. WHEN the application renders THEN both analytics solutions SHALL coexist without conflicts

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want analytics to work in production environment only, so that development and testing activities don't skew the analytics data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application runs in development mode THEN Vercel Analytics MAY be disabled or use test mode
2. WHEN the application is deployed to production THEN Vercel Analytics SHALL be fully active
3. WHEN analytics are configured THEN they SHALL respect environment-based loading similar to existing Google Analytics
4. IF the environment is not production THEN analytics tracking SHALL be appropriately handled

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure the analytics integration follows TypeScript best practices, so that the code is type-safe and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Analytics component is imported THEN it SHALL have proper TypeScript types
2. WHEN the code is compiled THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript errors related to analytics
3. WHEN the analytics code is written THEN it SHALL follow the existing code style and patterns
4. WHEN the integration is complete THEN it SHALL be consistent with the existing analytics implementation approach
